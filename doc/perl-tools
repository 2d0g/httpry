Along with the core httpry program there are included a number of Perl scripts.
This provides a listing of those files and a brief description of what each
script does. Run each tool with a -h parameter to get a listing of the
available command line parameters.

 ./content_check.pl
        Checks for specified content in the input file according to a "hitlist"
        of keywords. To properly analyze content, it breaks the input file into
        distinct flows which are time delimited blocks of traffic for each
        client IP. Also outputs some basic file/flow statistics.

 ./parse_log.pl
        Core script for plugins. Processes input log files and delivers the data
        to each initialized plugin. Plugins are activated by simply having a .pm
        extension and being placed in the specified plugin directory (default is
        ./plugins).

 ./plugins/find_proxies.pm
        Performs some basic tests looking for proxy usage.

 ./plugins/log_summary.pm
        Provides extensive information regarding the input file(s), visited
        hosts, top talkers and requested file extensions.

 ./plugins/sample_plugin.pm
        A simple plugin with no functionality designed as an easy way to see how
        the plugins are structured and to provide a sample framework for writing
        new plugins.

 ./plugins/search_terms.pm
        Outputs a raw dump of all entered search terms for a number of the major
        search services. The output is grouped by domain name.

 ./rotate_log.pl
        Moves an active log file into a specified directory. Also offers options
        for deleting text files, compressing the log files and purging old log
        files according to number or total size.
