A number of Perl scripts are included with the project to provide a log
parsing framework. There is a central Perl script (parse_log.pl) that handles
all of the core log parsing duties, and a set of Perl plugins (plugins/*.pm)
that perform assorted processing duties. It is straightforward to add your
own plugins to extend the processing abilities.

*** IMPORTANT! ***
parse_log.pl has an array at the top of the file that
contains plugins to ignore. By default, this array is populated with plugins
that either provide no output, or that generate errors by default (such as
trying to access a database). Make sure this array does not contain a plugin
you are trying to use. Additionally, any input log file needs to be a valid
httpry log file, including the field specifier at the top of the file.

The following Perl modules must be installed to run all included plugins:
        MIME::Lite
        DBI

A summary of the available functionality:

 ./scripts/rotate_log.pl
        Moves an active log file into a specified directory. Also offers
        options for deleting text files, compressing the log files and/or
        purging old log files according to number or total size.

 ./scripts/client_flows.pl
        A standalone version of the client_flows.pm plugin. Included mostly
        for historical reasons, should be considered depricated, and may
        disappear without warning.

 ./scripts/parse_log.pl
        Core script for plugins. Processes log files and delivers data to each
        initialized plugin. Plugins are utilized by having a .pm extension
        and being placed in the plugin directory (default is ./plugins). If
        a plugins directory is specified (-p), that is used instead. If
        no directory is specified, the script first searches the current
        directory for a plugin directory followed by the base directory of
        the script. The first directory found is used. If no directory is
        found, the script complains and exits. To ignore a plugin, either
        remove it from the plugin directory or add it to the @ignore array
        in parse_log.pl.

 ./scripts/plugins/client_flows.pm
        Breaks the input file into client flows which are time delimited
        blocks of traffic for each client IP. It is also able to search for
        specified content in the Host and Request-URI fields and flag flows
        accordingly. Because of the nature of its task, all server responses
        are discarded.

 ./scripts/plugins/db_dump.pm
        Dumps log file data into a previously prepared database. Useful
        for more extensive data mining or adding a more user-friendly web
        interface. Use the included db_dump.mysql to initialize the required
        database table.

 ./scripts/plugins/find_proxies.pm
        Performs some basic tests looking for proxy usage. The tests are
        currently rudimentary and quite a lot of noise is generated.

 ./scripts/plugins/log_summary.pm
        Provides extensive information regarding the input file(s) including
        visited hosts, top talkers and file extensions, along with other
        minor data.

 ./scripts/plugins/sample_plugin.pm
        An example plugin with no functionality designed as an easy way to
        see how the plugins are structured and to provide a base for writing
        new plugins.

 ./scripts/plugins/search_terms.pm
        Outputs a raw dump of all entered search terms for a number of the
        major search services. It also calculates the average length of
        extracted search queries.

 ./scripts/plugins/xml_format.pm
        Outputs the input log file in XML format.
