One feature that httpry allows is for the user to specify the output format
string that the program prints. This string is a comma-delimited list of
elements with *no* spaces between elements and capitalization is important.
Duplicate entries will be skipped and the parser will whine at you, so don't
do it. For example, the default format that is used if none is specified
consists of:

        Host,URI

This prints the hostname of the server and the URI of the requested resource.
There are three specific fields that can be specified from the request line:
Method, URI and Version. The request header fields are dynamically parsed and
so you can specify any request header that you require, even custom headers
not included in the HTTP standard. For reference, here is a list of the
standard RFC2616 headers:

        Accept
        Accept-Charset
        Accept-Encoding
        Accept-Language
        Authorization
        Expect
        From
        Host
        If-Match
        If-Modified-Since
        If-None-Match
        If-Range
        If-Unmodified-Since
        Max-Forwards
        Proxy-Authorization
        Range
        Referer
        TE
        User-Agent

There are of course other request header fields, but this should give you a
starting point. This means that you could build output format strings
consisting of:

        Host,User-Agent
        Referer,URI,Version
        If-Modified-Since,Method
        Host,URI,Method,If-Modified-Since,Referer,User-Agent
        ...etc...

There is no limit on the length of the string. This provides a relatively
flexible method for specifying the output string, while still supporting
unknown fields that might be needed. Additionally, the input ordering is
maintained so you can position the fields as necessary.
