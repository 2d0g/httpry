  HTTP logging and information display tool

  use secret agents. And he who is not delicate and subtle

----------------------
I. ABOUT
----------------------

httpry is a tool designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not
intended to perform analysis itself, but instead to capture, parse and/or log
the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the
traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It
is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be
easily adaptable to different applications.

The first question I asked myself when researching this project was "has this
already been done?" From the perspective I was approaching the problem, I couldn't
find a pre-existing solution. Certainly there are several existing tools that can
be combined to provide similar output, but none of those combinations seemed
to have the precise blend of features and performance I was looking for. If you
find a tool or set of tools that you feel is superior to httpry, let me know as
I'd like to take a look at it.

"How is this tool useful?" you may ask next. Well, here's a few ideas that have
occurred to me:

 - See what users on your network are requesting online
 - Check for proper server configuration (or improper, as the case may be)
 - Research patterns in HTTP usage
 - Watch for dangerous downloaded files
 - Verify the enforcement of HTTP policy on your network
 - Simple curiosity
 - It's just plain fun to watch in realtime

Of course, I hope that others will find additional uses for the tool beyond
what I've imagined. One might also note that, merely capturing and logging the
data is only the first step; the ability to effectively process the resulting
logs is what makes the information truly useful. To that end I've included
several Perl scripts that are post-processors for the log files. They are
relatively generic examples for various aspects of parsing and analyzing the
log files. Hopefully they will be of use for developing your own log parsing
toolset.


----------------------
II. INSTALLATION
----------------------

I was hoping you'd ask! Installing httpry is as simple as:

 $ make
 # make install

These commands will compile the latest version of the code and then install it
appropriately in /usr/sbin. Along with httpry itself, there are several Perl
scripts included. These tools may either be useful as-is, or as a starting point
for your own log parsing tools. Additionally, there is an included rc.httpry
file for automatically starting the program under Linux. This file has only been
tested under Slackware Linux; your distro may handle things differently.
Finally, if you ever tire of httpry, simply run:

 # make uninstall

from your installation directory, or just manually delete the executable and man
page.


----------------------
III. USAGE
----------------------

Running the program with the -h switch will print out an abbreviated description
of the available options. However, that switch is meant for quick reference and
not complete documentation of program behavior. This section describes these
options in greater detail.

httpry [-dhpv] [-b file] [-c count] [-f file] [-i interface] [-l filter]
       [-n count] [-o file] [-r dir] [-s string] [-u user]

-b <file> :
Dumps a binary packet capture output file to the specified location. Note that
these are packets that pass both the pcap filter and are successfully parsed as
HTTP packets.

-c <file> :
Provides a configuration file to read settings from at initialisation. These
settings can be overridden by command line arguments. See the included example
configuration file for the available options and proper syntax.

-d :
Runs the program as a daemon process. All program status output will be
sent to the syslog. A pid file is created for the process in /var/run/httpry.pid
by default. Requires -o.

-f <file> :
Provide an input capture file to read from instead of performing a
live capture. The program expects a valid capture file as input. Note that this
does not require the program to be run as root, as no access to the NIC is
required.

-h :
Displays a brief description of these options, after which the program
terminates.

-i <interface> :
Specifies an ethernet interface for the program to listen on.
This is optional; by default the program will poll the system for a list of
interfaces and select the first one that it finds.

-l <filter> :
Allows the default capture filter to be overridden by a filter
that follows the tcpdump format. Useful for capturing traffic on non-standard
ports or to/from specific hosts.

-n <count> :
Specifies a number of HTTP packets to parse, following which the
program will terminate.

-o <file> :
Provides an output file for writing parsed packet data. Note that if the
program is running as a daemon, its base directory is set to the filesystem
root (by default) so an absolute path to the output file should be specified.

-p :
Disables promiscuous mode on the NIC. Under most circumstances this should
not be required.

-r <dir> :
Allows a running directory to be specified when operating in daemon mode. By
default this is set to '/', which should be adequate for most uses.

-s <string> :
Specifies a comma-delimited string that defines the HTTP fields to output. See
the included documentation for the allowed options to use in this string.

-u <user> :
Allows an alternate user to take ownership of the process. This is
particularly useful when running in daemon mode. Note that you still need root
privileges in order to run the program; it will switch to the alternate
credentials once initialization is complete.

-v :
Displays the program name and version number, after which the program
terminates.

IV. FUTURE IDEAS
----------------------

These are ideas that have occurred to me while working on this project as
potential ways to improve or extend the code. I'm still not convinced all of
them are necessarily good ideas, but they are a source of inspiration and
consideration as I continue improving the project. A number indicates the
program version number I'm targeting to focus on that particular option.

* Internal packet queue to help with burst traffic
* Parent/worker threaded design
* Option to use rDNS when Host: string unavailable
* HTTP client/server session tracking
* Find alternative to using pcap_loop() for processing packets
* API to utilize data for real-time visualization applications
