# Here is a list of the config options and their
# possible values. Use a '0' to disable a
# particular option (unless it is required).
#
# $output_file (required)
#    A valid path to write an output file
#    containing the collected summary data.
#
# %domains (required)
#    A hash containing domain/name pairs to
#    search. The format is self-explanatory;
#    to augment it, simply add the domain and
#    the CGI name of the element to extract
#    the search term.
