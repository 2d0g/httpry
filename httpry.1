.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I httpry
is a tool designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not designed
to perform analysis itself, but instead to capture, parse and log the traffic
for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the live traffic on
the wire, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d"
Run the program as a daemon process. All program status output will be sent
to syslog. A pid file is created for the process in /var/run/httpry.pid by
default. Requires an output file specified with -o.
.IP "-h"
Display a brief description of these options.
.IP "-i \fIdevice\fP"
Specify an ethernet interface for the program to listen on. If not specified,
the program will poll the system for a list of interfaces and select the
first one found.
.IP "-n \fIcount\fP"
Parse this number of HTTP packets and then exit. Defaults to 0, which means
loop forever.
.IP "-o \fIfile\fP"
Specify an output file for writing parsed packet data.
.IP "-p"
Do not put the NIC in promiscuous mode on startup. Note that the NIC could
already be in that mode for another reason.
.IP "-q"
Hide non-critical output (startup banner, statistics, etc.).
.IP "-r \fIfile\fP"
Provide an input capture file to read from instead of performing
a live capture. This option does not require root privileges.
.IP "-s \fIstring\fP"
Specify a comma-delimited string that defines the parsed HTTP data to output.
See the doc/format-string file for further information regarding available
options and syntax.
.IP "-u \fIuser\fP"
Specify an alternate user to take ownership of the process and any output
files. You will need root privileges to do this; it will switch to the new
user after initialization.
.IP "expression"
Specify a bpf-style capture filter, overriding the default. Here are a few
examples starting with the default filter:

\'tcp port 80 or 8080\'
\'tcp dst port 80\'
\'tcp dst port 80 and src host 192.168.1.1\'

These filters will capture all web traffic both directions on two common
ports, capture only requests made to port 80, and capture requests to port
80 by a particular host, respectively. See man tcpdump for further
information on the syntax and available primitives.
