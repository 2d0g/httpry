.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I httpry
is a tool designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not designed
to perform analysis itself, but instead to capture, parse and log the traffic
for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is
parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d"
Run the program as a daemon process. All program status output
will be sent to the syslog. A pid file is created for the process in
/var/run/httpry.pid by default. Requires an output file.
.IP "-f \fIfilter\fP"
Specify a libpcap style capture filter. This is useful for narrowing
the traffic further than the default capture filter (or perhaps even
broadening the filter depending on the situation).
.IP "-h"
Display a brief description of these options.
.IP "-i \fIdevice\fP"
Specify an ethernet interface for the program to listen on. If not specified,
the program will poll the system for a list of interfaces and select the
first one found.
.IP "-n \fIcount\fP"
Parse this number of HTTP packets and then exit. Defaults to 0, which means
loop forever.
.IP "-o \fIfile\fP"
Specify an output file for writing parsed packet data.
.IP "-p"
Do not put the NIC in promiscuous mode on startup. Note that the NIC could
already be in that mode for another reason.
.IP "-r \fIfile\fP"
Provide an input capture file to read from instead of performing
a live capture. This option does not require root privileges.
.IP "-s \fIstring\fP"
Specify a comma-delimited string that defines the parsed HTTP data to output.
See the doc/format-string file for further information regarding available
options and syntax.
.IP "-u \fIuser\fP"
Specify an alternate user to take ownership of the process and any output
files. You will need root privileges to do this; it will switch to the new
user after initialization.
